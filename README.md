Fatal bear attacks in North America have occurred in a variety of settings. There have been several in the bears' wilderness habitats involving hikers, hunters, and campers. Brown bear (Ursus arctos), (a subspecies of which are known as grizzly bears, Ursus arctos horribilis ) incidents have occurred in their native range spanning Alaska, Northern and Western Canada, and portions of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. The locations of black bear wilderness fatal attacks reflect their wider range.

Bears held captive by animal trainers, in zoos, carnivals, or kept as pets have been responsible for several attacks. There have also been unusual cases in which a person entered a bear's cage and was then mauled.

Bear attacks are rare in North America. Attacks are for predatory, territorial, or protective reasons.[4] Most wilderness attacks have occurred when there were only one or two people in the vicinity.[5][6]

In this list, three species of bear are recognized: the brown bear (Ursus arctos, a subspecies of which is commonly known as the grizzly bear in the continental United States), the American black bear (Ursus americanus), and the polar bear (Ursus maritimus).
